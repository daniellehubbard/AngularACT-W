# Angular ACT-W

This is an example project with several phases for use in an Intro to AngularJS course at ACT-W PDX

To use, you  must first run npm install - you may need to separately run "npm install bower" and "npm install http-server"

Refer to directions in Angular seed project for more help: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed


Each level corresponds to a level of completeness of the project - level 4 is the "finished" product

The empty seed project has just an example controller and is there for you to use as a springboard to follow along in the workshop or create your own app.
